# Payment Management System

This is a **Payment Management System** built with **Vue 3**, designed for both Admins and Users to manage payments in a fintech-like environment. The app provides a **dashboard**, **role-based features**, and interactive tables for users and payments.

## Overview

The application supports **two roles**:

- **Admin** can:
  - View all users with their details (Name, Email, UPI ID, Phone Number, KYC Status).
  - View all payments between users.
  - Update the status of any payment (PENDING â†’ SUCCESS / FAILED).
  - Filter payments by status (ALL, PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILED).

- **User** can:
  - Create new payments to other users.
  - View all payments they are involved in (sent or received).
  - Filter their payments by status (ALL, PENDING, SUCCESS, FAILED).

The **dashboard** provides an overview of total users, total payments, and counts of payments by status (SUCCESS, PENDING, FAILED), displayed in interactive cards.
